# Exploratory Data Analysis on Formula 1

This repository contains an exploratory data analysis (EDA) on Formula 1 data. The analysis explores various aspects of Formula 1 including circuits, drivers, and constructors. Below is a summary of the analyses conducted:

## Analysis of Circuits

- Visualising circuits around the world on a world map using clusters.
- Determining the top 10 countries by the number of circuits.
- Identifying the circuits that have hosted the most Grand Prix races.
- Analyzing the climate zones of the circuits.

## Analysis of Drivers

- Calculating the average points scored by drivers after 2010.
- Examining driver status and their fastest laps.
- Identifying drivers with the best pitstop timings.

## Analysis of Constructors

- Determining the nationality to which most constructors belong.
- Identifying constructors that have won the most number of races.

## Additional Information

### Libraries Used:

- `numpy`: For numerical computations.
- `pandas`: For data manipulation and analysis.
- `plotly`: For interactive and visually appealing plots.
- `folium`: For visualizing geospatial data.
- `seaborn` and `matplotlib.pyplot`: For data visualization.
